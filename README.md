# FROGGY TIC TAC TOE
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/5EU2DeEmozM
#### Description: 
This is a simple tic tac toe multi-player game that you can play against someone else in your browser window. Simply decide who is going to be which player (1 - frog or 2 - flower) and select the space on the board where you'd like to place your character. The game ends when one player wins or when there is a tie. Select "reset" at any time to start a new game.

I started the project by considering the logic of the game. I made sure the game could be played just via commands, without any visuals at all, so I could concentrate on perfecting the basics without getting distracted by the visuals. In the file process.txt you can see a breakdown of how I approached the steps, using objects, IIFEs and object factories.

I then proceeded to create the simple layout in index.html for the gameboard, players, the "reset" button and a (hidden) modal which appears when the game is over to announce the winner (or a tie). 

I started with the most basic css to make sure the game worked with DOM interaction. Once that was done, I moved on to making it look pretty. I took inspiration from Pinterest because I wanted to put a bit of a spin on the classic game and make it thematic. I found a very cute "real-life" tic tac toe board made of clay with little frogs and flowers as the game pieces and a lily-pad as the "board", so I decided to use this as the basis for my design. I used Figma to work on the design, choosing an appropriate color palette, styling the modal, etc. After I was happy with the final look, I translated everything to the .css file. I considered adding additional textures and even creating a little triangular nook in the lilypad for more realism, but I decided against it as I preferred a "neater", more minimalist approach.
